   <h4>Parsing (Obsolete)</h4>

   <p class="conformance-level">A</p>

   <p>In content implemented using markup languages, elements have complete start and end
      tags, elements are nested according to their specifications, elements do not contain
      duplicate attributes, and any IDs are unique, except where the specifications allow
      these features.
   </p>

   <div class="note">
      <p>
         Modern web technologies have standardized how user agents parse incorrect markup. 
         Any invalid markup is therefore allowed under 4.1.1. Parsing for HTML 5 and CSS 3. 
         When using such technologies this success criterion is always satisfied. 
         This success criterion is therefore obsolete.
      </p><p>
         Issues such as incorrect states or names due to a duplicate ID, or missing roles 
         due to nesting interactive elements are covered by different success criteria.
      </p>
   </div>

   <p class="note">Start and end tags that are missing a critical character in their formation, such
      as a closing angle bracket or a mismatched attribute value quotation mark are not
      complete.
